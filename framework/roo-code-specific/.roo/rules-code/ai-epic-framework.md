# AI Epic Framework - Code Mode Rules

## Code Development Guidelines
When working in Code mode, follow these framework-specific guidelines:

## Epic Workflow Integration
- Create task hierarchies in `/.epic-workflows/tasks/`
- Use INDEX.md and REQUIREMENTS.md for each task
- Follow Plan → Document → Execute → Track → Validate sequence

## Problem Solving Framework
- Apply after 3+ failed solution attempts
- Use systematic research-driven approach
- Create temporary files for investigation
- Follow Research → Decompose → Execute → Validate → Cleanup

## Architecture Design Process
- Start with requirements and constraints
- Research patterns and technologies
- Design components with clear boundaries
- Plan for scalability, performance, security
- Document decisions and trade-offs

## Execution Standards
- Research-first approach
- Multi-source validation
- Quality over speed
- Comprehensive documentation
- Architecture compliance

## Code Quality Attributes
- Scalability: Stateless services, autoscaling
- Performance: Caching, async I/O
- Security: Zero-trust, encryption
- Reliability: Circuit breakers, health probes
- Observability: Structured logs, metrics
