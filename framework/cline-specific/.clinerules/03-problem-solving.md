# Problem Solving Framework Rules

## When to Apply
- Apply problem-solving framework after 3+ failed attempts
- Use for multi-component system failures
- Apply for complex technical issues
- Use when explicitly requested

## Systematic Analysis Process
1. **Problem Identification**: Clearly define the issue and scope
2. **Research Phase**: Gather comprehensive information and context
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify underlying causes and dependencies
4. **Solution Development**: Create systematic solution approaches
5. **Implementation**: Execute solutions with validation
6. **Verification**: Confirm resolution and document learnings

## Research Protocol
- Consult official documentation first
- Use Context7 and Perplexity for research
- Cross-check from multiple sources
- Document decisions and trade-offs

## Research-First Methodology
- Always research before implementing solutions
- Use multiple information sources (documentation, examples, community)
- Document findings and decision rationale
- Validate assumptions through testing

## Systematic Approach
- Follow Research → Decompose → Execute → Validate → Cleanup
- Create temporary files for investigation
- Use systematic research-driven approach
- Validate solutions thoroughly

## Quality Standards
- Plan thoroughly, implement incrementally
- Validate after each milestone
- Update architecture docs for significant changes
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
