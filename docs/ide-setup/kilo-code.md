## üéÆ Practical Examples

### Example 1: Open Source Epic Development

**Scenario**: Building an open source task management application

**VS Code Workflow**:
```
# Epic planning using VS Code tasks
Ctrl+Shift+P > Tasks: Run Task > Framework: Start Epic

Developer: "Using Epic Workflow, plan an open source task manager"

Kilo Code: "Creating epic structure for open source development:

Initiative: Open Source Task Manager
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Epic 1: Core Task Management (using open source patterns)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Epic 2: User Authentication (OAuth with passport.js)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Epic 3: Real-time Updates (Socket.io integration)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Epic 4: Data Persistence (PostgreSQL with Sequelize)

VS Code workspace configured with:
- Epic directories in .epic-workflows/
- Open source technology focus
- Community contribution guidelines
- Privacy-respecting development practices"
```

### Example 2: Privacy-Focused Problem Solving

**Scenario**: Performance issue investigation with privacy considerations

**VS Code Workflow**:
```
# Start investigation using framework
Ctrl+Shift+P > Tasks: Run Task > Framework: Investigation Mode

Developer: "Complex performance issue in React app, tried multiple optimizations"

Kilo Code: "Applying Problem Solving Framework with privacy focus:

Investigation Strategy:
1. Local performance profiling (no data sent externally)
2. VS Code debugging with React Developer Tools
3. Local network analysis and monitoring
4. Component profiling using open source tools

Evidence Collection:
- Browser performance timeline (locally stored)
- React component render analysis
- Bundle analysis with webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Memory profiling with VS Code debugger

This keeps all investigation data local while applying systematic methodology."
```

### Example 3: Open Source Architecture Design

**Scenario**: Choosing between open source state management solutions

**VS Code Workflow**:
```
# Architecture review using framework
Ctrl+Shift+P > Tasks: Run Task > Framework: Architecture Review

Developer: "Help me choose between Redux, Zustand, and Valtio for state management"

Kilo Code: "Applying Architecture Design Process with open source focus:

Requirements Analysis:
- Application complexity and state needs
- Team expertise and learning curve
- Bundle size and performance requirements
- Community support and maintenance

Open Source Evaluation:
1. Redux: Mature ecosystem, extensive tooling, larger bundle
2. Zustand: Lightweight, TypeScript-first, growing community  
3. Valtio: Proxy-based, minimal boilerplate, newer approach

Technology Decision Matrix:
[Evaluates based on your specific requirements]

Recommendation: [Based on systematic analysis]
Implementation Plan: [VS Code-compatible setup steps]"
```
