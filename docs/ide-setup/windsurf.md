## üìÅ Framework Structure

Your Windsurf adaptation includes:

```
framework/windsurf-specific/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .windsurfrules                       # Main framework rules (6K chars)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ global_rules.md                      # Extended documentation (optional)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ framework-components/                # Individual component files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ epic-workflow-summary.md        # Condensed workflow guide
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ problem-solving-summary.md      # Condensed troubleshooting
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture-summary.md         # Condensed design guidance
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ execution-standards-summary.md  # Condensed quality standards
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                           # Setup instructions
```

## üöÄ Installation

### Step 1: Copy Framework Rules

**Primary Installation**:
```bash
# Copy the main rules file to your project root
cp framework/windsurf-specific/.windsurfrules /path/to/your/project/

# Or if you're in your project directory
cp /path/to/ai-epic-framework/framework/windsurf-specific/.windsurfrules .
```

**Extended Documentation (Optional)**:
```bash
# Copy additional reference materials if needed
cp framework/windsurf-specific/global_rules.md /path/to/your/project/
cp -r framework/windsurf-specific/framework-components/ /path/to/your/project/
```

### Step 2: Verify Windsurf Recognition

**1. Open Windsurf IDE**:
- Open your project in Windsurf
- Windsurf automatically detects `.windsurfrules` files

**2. Check Rules Loading**:
- Look for confirmation that rules are loaded
- Test AI assistance to verify framework guidance is active

**3. Validate Character Limit**:
- Ensure `.windsurfrules` file is under 6,000 characters
- Windsurf will warn if the limit is exceeded

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

### Main Rules File (.windsurfrules)

The `.windsurfrules` file contains condensed framework guidance:

# AI Epic Framework for Windsurf

## Framework Overview
This project uses the AI Epic Framework for systematic project management, 
problem-solving, and architecture design. Apply these guidelines for 
consistent AI-assisted development.

## Core Components
- Epic Workflow: Initiative ‚Üí Epic ‚Üí Phase ‚Üí Step hierarchy
- Problem Solving: Systematic troubleshooting after 3+ failed attempts
- Architecture Design: Structured system design methodology
- Quality Standards: Consistent execution and documentation

## Component Loading Logic
Based on your query, reference the appropriate approach:

### Epic/Project Work
When planning features or managing projects:
- Break work into Initiative ‚Üí Epic ‚Üí Phase ‚Üí Step
- Use INDEX.md and REQUIREMENTS.md templates
- Apply sequential numbering and clear ownership
- Reference: epic-workflow-summary.md for details

### Problem Solving
When debugging complex issues (3+ failures, multi-component):
- Define problem clearly with impact assessment
- Plan systematic investigation approach
- Document evidence and test hypotheses
- Reference: problem-solving-summary.md for methodology

### Architecture Design
When designing systems or major changes:
- Gather functional and non-functional requirements
- Research and evaluate technology options
- Design for quality attributes (performance, security, reliability)
- Reference: architecture-summary.md for process

### Code Review/Quality
When reviewing code or ensuring standards:
- Apply systematic quality criteria
- Use evidence-based decision making
- Follow consistent documentation standards
- Reference: execution-standards-summary.md for guidelines

## Usage Patterns
- Specify which component you're using: "Using Epic Workflow, help me..."
- Reference component summaries for detailed methodology
- Apply framework principles consistently across team
- Document decisions and rationale for future reference

## Project Context
[Customize this section with your project-specific information]
- Tech Stack: [Your technologies]
- Team Practices: [Your methodologies]
- Quality Standards: [Your specific requirements]
```

### Character Limit Optimization

**Content Strategies**:
- **Essential Only**: Include only critical framework guidance
- **Condensed Language**: Use bullet points and short sentences
- **Reference System**: Point to detailed component files for full methodology
- **Project-Specific**: Customize content for your specific project needs

**Character Management**:
```bash
# Check character count of your .windsurfrules file
wc -c .windsurfrules

# Should be under 6,000 characters
# If over limit, trim non-essential content
```

## üéØ Usage Patterns

### Component Reference System

Since Windsurf has character limits, the framework uses a reference-based approach:

**Main Rules**: Core framework guidance (within 6K limit)
**Component Files**: Detailed methodology (unlimited size)

### Practical Usage

**1. Epic Planning**:
```
Developer: "Using the Epic Workflow approach, help me break down 
user authentication into phases and steps."

Windsurf: [References epic-workflow guidance from .windsurfrules and 
applies Initiative ‚Üí Epic ‚Üí Phase ‚Üí Step methodology]
```

**2. Problem Investigation**:
```
Developer: "I have a complex database performance issue. Using our 
Problem Solving Framework, help me investigate systematically."

Windsurf: [References problem-solving guidance and applies systematic 
investigation methodology]
```

**3. Architecture Planning**:
```
Developer: "I need to design a new microservice. Following our 
Architecture Design process, what should I consider?"

Windsurf: [References architecture guidance and applies systematic 
design methodology]
```

## üîß Customization for Windsurf

### Project-Specific Adaptations

**Technology Stack Integration**:
```markdown
## Project Context (Add to .windsurfrules)
**Tech Stack**: React + Node.js + PostgreSQL + Docker
**Architecture**: Microservices with REST APIs
**Team Practices**: Agile with 2-week sprints
**Quality Gates**: ESLint, Jest, TypeScript, Docker Compose

## Framework Application
When providing assistance:
- Consider our microservices architecture
- Reference our tech stack capabilities
- Apply our quality standards
- Follow our sprint-based delivery approach
```

**Team Workflow Integration**:
```markdown
## Team Development Process (Add to .windsurfrules)
1. All features follow Epic Workflow (Initiative ‚Üí Epic ‚Üí Phase ‚Üí Step)
2. Complex issues use Problem Solving Framework
3. Architecture changes require Design Process documentation
4. All code must meet our Execution Standards
```

### Optimizing for Character Limits

**Content Prioritization** (in order of importance):
1. **Framework Overview** (100-200 chars): What the framework is
2. **Component Loading Logic** (2000-3000 chars): When to use each component
3. **Usage Patterns** (1000-1500 chars): How to apply components
4. **Project Context** (1000-2000 chars): Project-specific adaptations

**Condensing Techniques**:
```markdown
# Instead of:
"The Epic Workflow Management system provides a comprehensive approach 
to breaking down large projects into manageable hierarchical structures..."

# Use:
"Epic Workflow: Break projects into Initiative ‚Üí Epic ‚Üí Phase ‚Üí Step hierarchy"

# Instead of:
"The Problem Solving Framework should be activated when you have attempted 
multiple solutions without success..."

# Use:
"Problem Solving: Use after 3+ failed attempts, multi-component issues"
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Rules Not Loading**:
```
Problem: Windsurf not applying framework rules
Solution:
- Verify .windsurfrules exists in project root
- Check file is under 6,000 character limit
- Restart Windsurf if needed
- Ensure file has correct markdown formatting
```

**2. Character Limit Exceeded**:
```
Problem: .windsurfrules file too large
Solution:
- Trim non-essential content
- Use more condensed language
- Move detailed content to component files
- Reference external files for full methodology
```

**3. Inconsistent Framework Application**:
```
Problem: AI not consistently applying framework
Solution:
- Be explicit: "Using Epic Workflow, help me..."
- Reference specific components in queries
- Ensure .windsurfrules content is clear and specific
- Test with framework-specific keywords
```

### Optimization Tips

**1. Content Efficiency**:
- Use bullet points instead of paragraphs
- Eliminate redundant words
- Use abbreviations for common terms
- Focus on actionable guidance

**2. Reference Strategy**:
