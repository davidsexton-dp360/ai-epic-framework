## üìÅ Framework Structure

Your Cursor-specific adaptation includes:

```
framework/cursor-specific/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-rules-template.mdc              # Main system prompt (navigation hub)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ epic-workflow-instructions.mdc       # Project workflow management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ problem-solving-framework.mdc        # Systematic troubleshooting
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture-design-process.mdc      # System design methodology
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture-lifecycle.mdc           # Documentation management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ general-execution-standards.mdc      # Quality and execution protocols
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                           # Setup instructions
```

## üöÄ Installation

### Step 1: Copy Framework Files

**Option A: Copy All Files (Recommended)**
```bash
# Copy entire Cursor framework to your project
cp -r framework/cursor-specific/* /path/to/your/project/

# Or if you're in your project directory
cp -r /path/to/ai-epic-framework/framework/cursor-specific/* .
```

**Option B: Selective Installation**
```bash
# Copy only the main navigation hub (minimal setup)
cp framework/cursor-specific/user-rules-template.mdc /path/to/your/project/

# Add additional components as needed
cp framework/cursor-specific/epic-workflow-instructions.mdc /path/to/your/project/
```

### Step 2: Configure Cursor AI

**1. Open Cursor Settings**:
- Press `Cmd+,` (macOS) or `Ctrl+,` (Windows/Linux)
- Navigate to "Rules" or "User Rules"

**2. Copy Framework Content to Cursor User Rules**:
- **Copy the content** from `user-rules-template.mdc` 
- **Paste it directly into Cursor's User Rules text area** in the settings
- This content serves as your navigation hub and will intelligently load other components

**3. Set Up Additional Components (Optional)**:
- Copy content from other `.mdc` files as needed for your project
- Or reference them as external files if you prefer file-based organization
- The navigation hub will guide Cursor to load appropriate components

**4. Verify Configuration**:
- Check that Cursor recognizes the framework content in your User Rules
- Test with a framework-specific query to ensure proper loading

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

### Main Navigation Hub (User Rules Content)

The content from `user-rules-template.mdc` becomes your central control point in Cursor's User Rules:

```yaml
---
name: "AI Epic Framework Navigation"
description: "Smart context management and workflow organization"
version: "1.0"
tags: ["workflow", "architecture", "problem-solving"]
priority: 1
---
```

**Key Features**:
- **Decision Matrix**: Automatically determines which components to load based on your queries
- **Token Optimization**: Prevents context window overload by loading only relevant content
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Scales complexity based on task needs
- **Framework Navigation**: Guides Cursor to apply appropriate systematic approaches

### Component Loading Logic

The framework uses intelligent triggers to load specific components:

| Trigger Keywords | Loaded Component | Purpose |
|-----------------|------------------|---------|
| "epic", "initiative", "project" | Epic Workflow Management | Project structure and task hierarchy |
| "debug", "problem", "troubleshoot" | Problem Solving Framework | Systematic issue investigation |
| "architecture", "design", "component" | Architecture Design Process | System design methodology |
| "document", "lifecycle", "maintain" | Architecture Lifecycle | Documentation management |
| "review", "quality", "standards" | General Execution Standards | Quality protocols and guidelines |

## üéØ Usage Patterns

### Basic Workflow

**1. Start Every Session**:
```
Load the user-rules-template.mdc as your primary rule
This establishes the navigation hub and decision matrix
```

**2. Conditional Component Loading**:
```
When starting epic work ‚Üí Framework loads Epic Workflow Management
When debugging issues ‚Üí Framework loads Problem Solving Framework  
When designing systems ‚Üí Framework loads Architecture Design Process
```

**3. Token-Efficient Operation**:
```
Only relevant components load for current task
Context window preserved for actual problem-solving
Multiple components can be loaded when needed
```

### Advanced Features

**1. Multi-Component Scenarios**:
```
Complex feature development:
‚Üí Load Epic Workflow (structure) + Architecture Design (technical) + Execution Standards (quality)

Complex debugging:
‚Üí Load Problem Solving (investigation) + Architecture Design (if changes needed) + Execution Standards (research)
```

**2. Custom Triggers**:
You can add custom triggers to the decision matrix:
```markdown
### Your Custom Trigger
**Load When:**
- User mentions "your-keyword"
- Specific project phases
- Custom workflow scenarios

**Related Documentation:**
- [your-component.mdc] - Your custom component
```

## üîß Customization for Cursor

### Cursor-Specific Optimizations

**1. YAML Frontmatter Usage**:
```yaml
