## üìÅ Framework Structure

Your GitHub Copilot adaptation includes:

```
framework/github-copilot-specific/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ copilot-instructions.md          # Main GitHub Copilot instructions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ framework/                       # Framework components directory
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ epic-workflow-guide.md       # Project workflow management
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ problem-solving-guide.md     # Systematic troubleshooting
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture-design.md       # System design methodology
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture-lifecycle.md    # Documentation management

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                           # Setup instructions
```

## üöÄ Installation

### Step 1: Copy Framework to Repository

**1. Copy GitHub Directory Structure**:
```bash
# Copy the entire .github directory to your repository root
cp -r framework/github-copilot-specific/.github /path/to/your/repository/

# Or if you're in your repository root
cp -r /path/to/ai-epic-framework/framework/github-copilot-specific/.github .
```

**2. Verify Structure**:
```bash
# Check that the structure is correct
ls -la .github/
# Should show: copilot-instructions.md and framework/ directory
```

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Copilot

**1. Ensure GitHub Copilot is Enabled**:
- Verify GitHub Copilot subscription is active
- Enable Copilot in your IDE (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.)
- Check that Copilot has access to your repository

**2. Verify Instructions Loading**:
- GitHub Copilot automatically reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- No additional configuration needed
- Instructions apply to all team members with Copilot access

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

### Main Instructions File

The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` serves as your central framework controller:

```markdown
# AI Epic Framework for GitHub Copilot

This repository uses the AI Epic Framework for systematic project management, 
problem-solving, and architecture design. Follow these guidelines for consistent
AI-assisted development across the team.

## Framework Components

The framework consists of several specialized components that should be loaded
based on the current development context...
```

**Key Features**:
- **Universal Loading**: Automatically active for all team members
- **Repository Context**: Applies to entire codebase
- **Team Consistency**: Shared prompts and approaches
- **Git Integration**: Version controlled with your code

### Component Reference System

Unlike IDE-specific conditional loading, GitHub Copilot uses a reference-based approach:

| Development Activity | Referenced Components | Usage Pattern |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Feature Development** | Epic Workflow + Architecture Design | Reference both guides when planning features |
| **Bug Investigation** | Problem Solving + Execution Standards | Apply systematic troubleshooting |
| **Code Review** | Execution Standards + Architecture Design | Ensure quality and architectural consistency |
| **Documentation** | Architecture Lifecycle + Epic Workflow | Follow documentation standards |

## üéØ Usage Patterns

### Team-Wide Workflow

**1. Repository-Level Context**:
```
All developers automatically get framework guidance
Consistent prompts across entire team
Shared understanding of processes and standards
```

**2. Component Reference**:
```
Reference specific framework components in your requests:
"Following the Epic Workflow, help me break down this feature..."
"Using the Problem Solving Framework, help me debug this issue..."
"According to our Architecture Design process, what's the best approach..."
```

**3. Contextual Application**:
```
GitHub Copilot understands repository context
Framework applies to current codebase and project
Suggestions align with established patterns
```

### Practical Usage

**1. Feature Development**:
```
Developer: "I need to implement user authentication. Following our Epic Workflow,
help me break this down into phases and steps."

GitHub Copilot: [References Epic Workflow component and provides structured breakdown]
```

**2. Problem Solving**:
```
Developer: "The payment system is failing intermittently. Using our Problem Solving
Framework, help me investigate this systematically."

GitHub Copilot: [References Problem Solving component and guides systematic investigation]
```

**3. Architecture Decisions**:
```
Developer: "I need to design a new microservice. According to our Architecture Design
process, what should I consider?"

GitHub Copilot: [References Architecture Design component and provides design guidance]
```

## üîß Customization for GitHub Copilot

### Repository-Specific Adaptations

**1. Project Context Integration**:
```markdown
# In .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Project-Specific Context
This is a [Web Application/API/Mobile App] built with [Tech Stack].
Our team follows [Agile/Scrum/Kanban] methodology.

4. All changes must meet Execution Standards criteria
```

### Adding Custom Components

**1. Create Custom Component File**:
```bash
# Add new component to framework directory
vim .github/framework/your-custom-component.md
```

**2. Reference in Main Instructions**:
```markdown
# In .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Custom Components
- **Your Custom Component**: Reference .github/framework/your-custom-component.md
  for [specific use case]. Use when [trigger conditions].
```

**3. Team Communication**:
```markdown
## Using Custom Components
When working on [specific scenarios], reference our custom component:
"Following our [Custom Component Name], help me [specific task]..."
```

## üéÆ Practical Examples
