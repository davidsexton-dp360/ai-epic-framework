### Step 3: Configure Enterprise Framework

**1. Initialize Enterprise Framework**:
```bash
# Initialize framework for enterprise
zencoder framework init --enterprise --config ~/.zencoder/enterprise/framework/enterprise-config.json

# Set framework rules for different formats
zencoder rules set --format native --file framework-rules.rules
zencoder rules set --format cursor --file cursor-compatibility.cursorrules
zencoder rules set --format cline --file cline-compatibility.clinerules
```

**2. Configure Team Access**:
```bash
# Set up team-specific framework access
zencoder team config --development-team team-configurations/development-team-config.json
zencoder team config --architecture-team team-configurations/architecture-team-config.json
zencoder team config --qa-team team-configurations/qa-team-config.json
```

**3. Verify Enterprise Setup**:
```bash
# Test enterprise framework functionality
zencoder framework test --all-formats
zencoder team verify --all-teams
zencoder integrations test --all-apis
```

## üéØ Usage Patterns

### Enterprise Framework Application

**1. Multi-Team Epic Coordination**:
```
# Development team member
Developer: "Using Epic Workflow, plan microservices architecture for customer portal"

Zencoder Response:
1. Activates Epic Workflow component with enterprise features
2. Creates cross-team epic structure visible to architecture team
3. Integrates with JIRA for project tracking
4. Notifies architecture team via Slack integration
5. Documents in Confluence with governance approval workflow
```

**2. Enterprise Problem Escalation**:
```
# QA team member
QA Engineer: "Complex performance issue affecting multiple services, tried standard debugging"

Zencoder Response:
1. Recognizes Problem Solving Framework trigger with enterprise escalation
2. Applies systematic investigation with audit logging
3. Escalates to architecture team when complexity threshold reached
4. Creates JIRA ticket with investigation timeline
5. Notifies management via dashboard when critical thresholds met
```

**3. Architecture Governance Workflow**:
```
# Architecture team member  
Architect: "Review technology choice for new payment processing system"

Zencoder Response:
1. Activates Architecture Design Process with governance controls
2. Applies enterprise architectural review workflow
3. Documents decision rationale in Confluence
4. Routes through architecture governance approval process
5. Updates enterprise architecture standards automatically
```

### Enterprise Team Benefits

**1. Cross-Team Coordination**:
- Epic visibility across development, architecture, and QA teams
- Automatic notification of cross-team dependencies
- Shared framework methodology for consistent approaches
- Enterprise-wide epic completion tracking and analytics

**2. Governance and Compliance**:
- All framework operations logged for audit trails
- Architecture decisions routed through governance processes
- Compliance monitoring for industry-specific requirements
- Enterprise security controls for sensitive project information

**3. Enterprise Tool Integration**:
- JIRA integration for epic and problem tracking
- Confluence integration for framework documentation
- Slack integration for team coordination and notifications
- GitHub Enterprise integration for code and epic alignment

### Example 1: Enterprise Epic Development

**Scenario**: Large-scale customer portal development across multiple teams

**Enterprise Workflow**:
```
# Development team lead
Developer: "Using Epic Workflow, plan enterprise customer portal with authentication, payments, and analytics"

Zencoder Enterprise: "Creating enterprise epic structure with cross-team coordination:

Initiative: Enterprise Customer Portal (tracked in JIRA EPIC-2024-Q1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Epic 1: Authentication & Authorization (Dev Team A + Security Team)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Epic 2: Payment Processing (Dev Team B + Architecture Team)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Epic 3: Analytics Dashboard (Dev Team C + Data Team)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Epic 4: Admin Portal (Dev Team A + QA Team)

Enterprise Coordination:
- Cross-team dependencies identified and tracked in JIRA
- Architecture governance triggered for payment processing decisions
- Security review scheduled for authentication epic
- QA involvement planned from epic initiation
- Management dashboard configured for progress tracking

Confluence documentation created with governance approval workflow."
```

### Example 2: Enterprise Problem Escalation

**Scenario**: Critical performance issue affecting multiple microservices

**Enterprise Workflow**:
```
# QA Engineer reports issue
QA: "Critical performance degradation in microservices, affecting customer experience"

Zencoder Enterprise: "Activating enterprise Problem Solving Framework with escalation:

Investigation Classification: Critical (affects customer experience)
Teams Involved: QA (lead), Development (support), Architecture (governance)
Escalation Level: Management notification triggered

Systematic Investigation:
1. QA leads evidence collection with enterprise audit logging
2. Development teams provide service-specific analysis  
3. Architecture team evaluates system-wide impact
4. Management dashboard updated with real-time status

Enterprise Features Activated:
- JIRA incident ticket created with SLA tracking
- Slack war room channel established
- Architecture governance notified for potential design changes
- Compliance team alerted for customer impact assessment

All investigation data logged for post-incident review."
```

### Example 3: Enterprise Architecture Governance

**Scenario**: Technology choice for new payment processing system

**Enterprise Workflow**:
```
# Architecture team member
Architect: "Evaluate microservices framework for new payment processing system"

Zencoder Enterprise: "Applying Architecture Design Process with enterprise governance:

Architecture Decision: Payment Processing Framework Selection
Governance Level: Executive (financial system impact)
Teams Involved: Architecture (lead), Security, Compliance, Development

Enterprise Architecture Review:
1. Requirements analysis with compliance team input
2. Technology evaluation with security threat assessment
3. Cost-benefit analysis with finance team consultation
4. Implementation plan with development team capacity planning

Governance Workflow:
- Architecture decision record created in Confluence
- Security architecture review scheduled
- Compliance impact assessment initiated  
- Executive architecture committee approval required
- Implementation timeline coordinated with development teams

All decisions tracked in enterprise architecture repository with audit trail."
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Multi-Format Rule Conflicts**:
```bash
# Check rule format priorities
zencoder rules list --all-formats --priority-order
