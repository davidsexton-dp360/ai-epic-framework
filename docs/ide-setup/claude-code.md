# AI Epic Framework for Claude Code

## Framework Overview
You are using the AI Epic Framework to help developers build complex applications systematically. Apply framework components based on the developer's needs and query context.

## Decision Matrix
Based on developer queries, activate appropriate framework components:

### Epic Workflow (epic-workflow.md)
**Activate when**: Developer mentions large features, project planning, or complex application development
**Keywords**: "epic", "project", "feature", "workflow", "planning", "application"
**Purpose**: Break down complex applications into manageable Initiative ‚Üí Epic ‚Üí Phase ‚Üí Step hierarchies

### Problem Solving (problem-solving.md)  
**Activate when**: Developer has tried multiple solutions, complex debugging, or systematic investigation needed
**Keywords**: "debug", "problem", "troubleshoot", "investigate", "complex", "failed attempts"
**Purpose**: Systematic investigation approach for stubborn technical issues

### Architecture Design (architecture-design.md)
**Activate when**: Developer needs system design, technology choices, or architectural decisions
**Keywords**: "architecture", "design", "component", "system", "structure", "technology choice"
**Purpose**: Structured approach to architectural decision-making

### Execution Standards (execution-standards.md)
**Activate when**: Developer needs code review, quality assurance, or best practices guidance

```

## üéÆ Practical Examples

### Example 1: Terminal-Based Epic Development

**Scenario**: Building a task management application

**Terminal Workflow**:
```bash
# Start epic planning
$ claude-code epic plan

Claude: "Let's break down your task management application:

Initiative: Task Management Platform
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Epic 1: User Authentication & Profiles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Epic 2: Task Creation & Management  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Epic 3: Team Collaboration Features
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Epic 4: Reporting & Analytics

Let's start with Epic 1. Creating directory structure..."

# Framework creates structure
.epic-workflows/tasks/INITIATIVE_01_TASK_PLATFORM/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EPIC_01_USER_AUTH/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ INDEX.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ REQUIREMENTS.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ phases/
```

### Example 2: Terminal-Based Problem Solving

**Scenario**: Database performance issue

**Terminal Workflow**:
```bash
# Start systematic investigation
$ claude-code investigate

Claude: "I'll guide you through systematic problem investigation:

Step 1: Problem Definition
- What exactly is slow? (queries, connections, specific operations)
- When did this start?
- What have you tried?

Step 2: Evidence Collection
Let's gather data systematically:
```
# Check query performance
$ explain analyze SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

# Check connection stats  
$ SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';
```

This evidence will help identify the root cause..."
```

### Example 3: Terminal-Based Architecture Design

**Scenario**: API design for microservices

**Terminal Workflow**:
```bash
# Start architecture design session
$ claude-code design api

Claude: "Let's design your API systematically:

Requirements Analysis:
1. What services need to communicate?
2. What are your performance requirements?
3. What's your team's expertise with different API patterns?

Based on your answers, I'll recommend:
- REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC
- Authentication patterns
- Error handling strategies
- Documentation approaches

Let's start with service boundaries..."
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Framework Not Loading**:
```bash
# Check configuration
claude-code config show

# Verify framework files
ls -la ~/.claude-code/framework/

# Test framework loading
claude-code test-framework --verbose
```

**2. Component Files Not Found**:
```bash
# Check component paths
claude-code config show components

# Verify component files exist
find ~/.claude-code/framework -name "*.md"

# Update component paths if needed
claude-code config set components.epic-workflow.file "/correct/path/epic-workflow.md"
```

**3. Terminal Display Issues**:
```bash
# Check terminal settings
claude-code config show settings.terminal-friendly

# Adjust for your terminal
claude-code config set settings.terminal-width 120
claude-code config set settings.color-output true
```

### Optimization Tips

**1. Session Management**:
- Use descriptive session names for different projects
- Save framework state between terminal sessions
- Use project-specific configurations for different applications
- Regular cleanup of investigation and design files

**2. Terminal Workflow**:
- Set up shell aliases for common framework commands
- Use terminal multiplexer for persistent sessions
- Configure output formatting for your terminal preferences
- Integrate with existing terminal-based development tools

**3. Framework Integration**:
- Align framework usage with existing terminal workflows
