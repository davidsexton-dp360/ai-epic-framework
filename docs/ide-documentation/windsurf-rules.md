# Windsurf Rules Documentation

## Overview
There are two mechanisms for this in Windsurf: Memories, which can be automatically generated by Cascade, and rules, which are manually defined by the user at both the local and global levels.

## How to Manage Memories
Memories and Rules can be accessed and configured at any time by clicking on the Customizations icon in the top right slider menu in Cascade, or via "Windsurf - Settings" in the bottom-right hand corner. To edit an existing memory, simply click into it and then click the Edit button.

## Memories
During conversation, Cascade can automatically generate and store memories if it encounters context that it believes is useful to remember.

Additionally, you can ask Cascade to create a memory at any time. Just prompt Cascade to "create a memory of â€¦".

Cascade's autogenerated memories are associated with the workspace that they were created in and Cascade will retrieve them when it believes that they are relevant. Memories generated in one workspace will not be available in another.

**Creating and using auto-generated memories do NOT consume credits**

## Rules
Users can explicitly define their own rules for Cascade to follow.

Rules can be defined at either the global level or the workspace level.
- `global_rules.md` - rules applied across all workspaces
- `.windsurf/rules` - workspace level repo containing rules that are tied to globs or natural language descriptions.

To get started with Rules, click on the Customizations icon in the top right slider menu in Cascade, then navigate to the Rules panel. Here, you can click on the + Global or + Workspace button to create new rules at either the global or workspace level, respectively.

You can find example rule templates curated by the Windsurf team at https://windsurf.com/editor/directory to help you get started.

**Rules files are limited to 12000 characters each.**

## Activation Modes
At the rule level, you can define how a rule should be activated for Cascade.

There are 4 modes:

1. **Manual**: This rule can be manually activated via @mention in Cascade's input box
2. **Always On**: This rule will always be applied
3. **Model Decision**: Based on a natural language description of the rule the user defines, the model decides whether to apply the rule.
4. **Glob**: Based on the glob pattern that the user defines (e.g. `.js`, `src/**/.ts`), this rule will be applied to all files that match the pattern.

## Best Practices
To help Cascade follow your rules effectively, follow these best practices:

- Keep rules simple, concise, and specific. Rules that are too long or vague may confuse Cascade.
- There's no need to add generic rules (e.g. "write good code"), as these are already baked into Cascade's training data.
- Format your rules using bullet points, numbered lists, and markdown. These are easier for Cascade to follow compared to a long paragraph. For example:

```markdown
# Coding Guidelines 
- My project's programming language is python
- Use early returns when possible
- Always add documentation when creating new functions and classes
```

XML tags can be an effective way to communicate and group similar rules together. For example:

```xml
<coding_guidelines>
- My project's programming language is python
- Use early returns when possible
- Always add documentation when creating new functions and classes
</coding_guidelines>
```

## Rule Structure
Rules in Windsurf follow a specific structure that allows for flexible activation and organization:

### Global Rules
Global rules are stored in `global_rules.md` and apply across all workspaces. These are typically used for:
- Personal coding preferences
- General development practices
- Cross-project standards

### Workspace Rules
Workspace rules are stored in `.windsurf/rules` and apply only to the current workspace. These are typically used for:
- Project-specific coding standards
- Framework-specific guidelines
- Team conventions

### Rule File Format
Each rule file can contain multiple rules, organized by categories or activation modes. Rules can be written in plain text or markdown format.

## Examples

### Example 1: Python Project Rules
```markdown
# Python Development Guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use virtual environments for dependency management
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
```

### Example 2: React Project Rules
```markdown
# React Development Standards
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow component naming conventions (PascalCase)
```

### Example 3: API Development Rules
```markdown
# API Development Guidelines
- Use RESTful principles for endpoint design
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Include comprehensive API documentation
- Use authentication and authorization
```

## Integration with Memories
Rules and memories work together to provide Cascade with comprehensive context:
- **Rules** provide explicit, structured guidance
- **Memories** provide contextual, automatically-generated insights
- Both are used together to inform Cascade's responses and suggestions

## Advanced Usage
For more complex scenarios, you can:
- Use glob patterns to apply rules only to specific file types
- Combine multiple activation modes for flexible rule application
- Create rule hierarchies with global and workspace-specific rules
- Use natural language descriptions to let the model decide when to apply rules

## Troubleshooting
If rules aren't being applied as expected:
1. Check that the rule file is in the correct location
2. Verify that the rule file doesn't exceed the 12,000 character limit
3. Ensure the activation mode is appropriate for your use case
4. Test with simpler rules first to verify the system is working
